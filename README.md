# DjanGoat

DjanGoat is a vulnerable Django Application based in large part off the [RailsGoat](https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat) project. The application purports to be an internal employee portal for MetaCorp, Inc but includes vulnerabilities from the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) and is intended to be used as an educational tool for developers and security professionals. 

## Installation

On a mac, first install python.

### Initial Setup

Requirements:

 - Python 2.7
 - Pip
 - mysql (optional)

Begin by creating a virtual-env
```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
```

Then install using pip
```
    make install
```

### DB-Setup

#### SQLite
   
Djangoat uses a SQLite database by default. To deploy the server locally with a SQLite database, use:
```
    make run
```

This will initialize and migrate a new (gitignored) SQLite database `db.sqlite3` in the root project directory. It will then run the server locally.

At any point after the database has been migrated, it can be seeded with `python manage.py seed`.

#### MySQL

1. Make sure you have mysql installed and run the following to
setup the database

```
    mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE `db_name`;
    CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `db_name`.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    quit
```

2. Go to pygoat/production_settings.py and fill out the given information for your database.

3. Migrate the models and associated database data

```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
```

4. To set up seed data you can run:

```
    python manage.py seed
```

For developers create a local_settings.py file in the pygoat folder
that mocks production_setting.py.

If Django does not recognize MySQL after the setup above, try installing mysql-python and migrate again

```
    pip install mysql-python
```

Finally run on localhost:8000
```
    python manage.py runserver
```

#### PostgreSQL

If you want to setup DjanGoat with a PostgreSQL database, checkout the PostgreSQL branch with the following command:
```
    $ git checkout postgresql-database
```
The PostgreSQL branch has modified documentation and tests.

### Testing
To run tests, simply run:
```
    make test
```


### Linting

To run `pylint` using the provided `.pylintrc` configuration file:
```
    make lint
```
